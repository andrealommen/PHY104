I'll put the Jupyter notebook we'll be working on in class [here:]
(https://haverford.box.com/s/dbv4p4j7s9fc3mosjw13p8tz2q6g83h4)

After class I'll put another copy that's filled in with whatever we did in class. It'll have the same name but with "POST" in the title.

To upload them into your Jupyter account:
1) Download the file you want onto your computer using the link above. (It doesn't work to click on the file you want, you have to go over to the 3 dots on the right and select "download.") The thing is that your computer won't know how to open the file, but your Jupyter account will, so then you have to do step 2. 
2) On the [Jupyter home screen](https://notebook.kinsc.haverford.edu:8000/hub/home) over on the right click "Upload" and choose the file you just downloaded onto your computer. Sometimes the tricky part here is figuring out where your
computer put it in step (1).  Check the downloads folder.


I don't anticipate using slides often, but if I do I'll put them in this [Google folder.](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kO5yrrRfV2F_5RYDTpYBTOIKAQNyKM9S?usp=sharing)
