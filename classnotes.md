I'll put the Jupyter notebook we'll be working on in class [here:](https://haverford.box.com/s/mdp4kdykmxzq7iuvwo7sfiveptaqr6qk)

After class I'll put another copy that's filled in with whatever we did in class.

To upload them into your Jupyter account:
* Download the file you want onto your computer using the link above.
* On the [Jupyter home screen](https://notebook.kinsc.haverford.edu:8000/hub/home) over on the right click "Upload" and choose the file you just downloaded onto your computer.
