You may read this page as much as you want before taking the final.  When
you're ready to take the final click on the link at the bottom to download the
pdf.   These are the instructions for the exam.

## How to study for the exam:
* Do all the quizzes and the midterm, even the questions that seem hard or
weird.  All of
the questions of the exam relate to something that's on a quiz or on a midterm.
On some of the quizzes I said "I could never ask this on an exam...." but in 
most of those cases I figured out a way to ask that on the exam.
* I still have office hours you can sign up for if you have questions.
* You will find all the answers to the quizzes and mid-term embedded in
the ipynb notebooks.


## Exam instructions
1. Before you begin please email me and tell me you are starting.
2. You have 3 hours to complete this exam.
3. There are various ways you can complete the exam. The most important criterion is that your answers should be legible and should be in numerical order. You may 
	(a) print this out, write your answers on the sheet, and scan it at the end (scanning time does not count against your three hours.) 
	(b) write your answers on a separate sheet of paper, and scan them 
	(c) type your answers in a google doc or Word (or similar) and email them to you. 

	For (b) and (c) make sure each question is very clearly labeled.

4. This is a closed book exam. No notes or other aids are allowed
5. The exam contains 26 questions numbered sequentially. Make sure you have all the pages and have answered all the questions. Each question’s
point value is next to its number. The total exam is worth 46 points.
6. In order to be eligible for as much partial credit as possible, show all of your work for each problem, and
clearly indicate your answers. Credit cannot be given for illegible answers.
7. Python code that you write should be as close to correct (runnable) as possible. Small syntax errors will
not cost you points, but unclear indentation will.
8. Be sure to appropriately comment any code that you write. You may lose points for correct but
uncommented code.
9. When finished please scan it and drop it in the dropbox I shared with you. Scanning time does not count toward your 3 hours.
10. If you have a question please email me, but I may not respond in time. If you feel an exam question assumes something that is not written, write it down on your exam sheet. Barring some unforeseen error on the exam, however, you shouldn’t need to do this at all, so be careful when making assumptions.
11. Be sure to read the entire exam before answering any questions, so you have time to think about the potentially tricky problems.
12. This examination is NOT to be shared with students who take this class in subsequent years, nor circulated in any manner. Thank you for abiding by the Honor Code of Haverford College in respecting this restriction.
13. On the exam you will sign saying that you have abided by the Haverford Honor code.
