Topics in Introductory Programming (104) is designed to give a general
introduction to programming as related to data analysis across many
fields. Currently there are versions of this class at Haverford in Linguistics,
Social Science, Chemistry, Physics and Astronomy.
In all of these classes students will be introduced to standard introductory
programming imperative and object oriented techniques as well as data
structures necessary to create efficient and understandable
algorithmic solutions to problems. Data for analysis will be drawn
from a single discipline that will vary per semester, forming a theme
for topical study. Topical investigations will include the ethics of
data use in that field, how data is commonly generated and used, and
implementation of important discipline-specific algorithms.

The version of 104 upon which you are gazing is oriented toward the discipline of Physics and Astronomy. In particular we learn techniques that will be valuable for physicists and astronomers such as curve fitting, working with large public data sets, plotting, SQL queries, and numerical integration.
