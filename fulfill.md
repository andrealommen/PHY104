## Engage in as many different ways as you can.
In order for me to deliver on the promises, we need to
engage in much more than me talking and you listening and you writing
computer code. You will learn acquire and access these skills in
a number of different ways.
Research shows that the more different ways you engage you with
concepts, the more likely you are to be able to use that concept in
the future. Sometimes I will actually just talk and ask you to listen
(otherwise known as a lecture) but that's not my favorite style
of skill transference, mostly because it never worked very well
for me when I was on the receiving end. There are some people who
thrive on it,
and so we will try to do some lecturing, some working things out
together, sometimes you teaching, sometimes you learning things outside of
class and coming to class to practice.

## We need to be a team.  
Each of
you has something to contribute to the operation of this team.  Thank
goodness not all of you has the same thing to contribute to the
operation of the team.  That would be boring and it wouldn't work very
well.  So first, please when you notice someone has something to
contribute that isn't currently in your skill/knowledge set please
practice saying something to yourself like, ``This team is great!  I'm glad we all
have different skills."

## Be responsible for creating circumstances that help you learn.
I remember in college (Carleton) that when I would talk over a problem
with a peer sometimes I would actually start to get mad, because I
could tell they were thinking about it in a different way, and I
wasn't ready to stop thinking about it my way yet. I knew I almost had
a solution, and if I thought about it their way, I was going to have
to take down my own scaffolding.  At the time I doubt I could've
articulated the idea of scaffolding.  In any case, I hope I was pretty
good at not actually getting mad at my friend, and saying "Thank you,
I need to go work on this by myself a little bit now," and working by
myself.  Then when I had my scaffolding up - my way of understanding
it, I could usually go back to that person and say, ``could you tell me
again how you solved it?"  And then comparing my solution to theirs
was really helpful and deepened my understanding of the problem.

## Notice how you learn best. 
You each have different
experiences solving problems and working with peers.
Notice what ways of working deliver the largest gains
in the promises of the course.  I am asking nothing less than
consciousness about the way you learn new things
(starting with today's paper, but also throughout the course).
At the end of each lab you'll jot down some thoughts
what you noticed about your learning process. This is a really
important moment in your learning to take a step back and think
about how it went, and what produced your successes and failures.
