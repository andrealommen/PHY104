In solving problems, everyone (doctors, musicians,
biologists, computer scientists...) goes down paths that ultimately
prove wrong.  **How can you use those (wrong) paths to gain important
insights into the ultimate solution?**  In this course you have the
opportunity to develop these skills. In this course you have the
opportunity to develop your ability to make profitable "wrong turns"
in problem solving.

**How do you break down a really complex problem into solvable parts?**
Some parts you can separate and some you cannot.  In this course you
have the opportunity to develop your ability to tackle really complex
problems by breaking them down, wisely, into parts.

**What do you do with problems that are presented to you in a misleading
way**  This happens unintentionally all the time. One of your
collaborators or a team member comes to you with problem that he/she
is sure is caused by another person.  Or a patient comes in with a set
of symptoms and is sure she/he has strep throat and is prepared to
convince you of this.  You need to be the person who has enough
perspective to consider that "Do you have strep throat?" is the wrong
question.  What's the right question?  In this course you have the
opportunity to develop your ability to deal wisely with the different
pieces of information provided to you.

**Finally, after you've come up with a solution to a problem, how do you
determine if it is the right one?**  What checks can you do to confirm
that your solution is the best one?  In this course you have the
opportunity to develop your skill at checking your answer, determining
if its reasonable, and relating it to other things you know (without
having a "back of the book" to check!)
This is incredibly important in programming. There are sort of two levels
of a program "working". The first level is where it actually runs with
no errors. This is great, and it's a great achievement, but it's not
the same thing as a program actually doing what you wanted it to do,
and it's really important to be able to tell the difference. It's easy
to tell whether a program "works" at the first level, but it requires
some really fun thinking and fun testing to determine if it's doing
what you thought it should do.

**Finally, programming is a very useful skill, and it's becoming more useful
everyday.** There's a reason this course is being offered in
chemistry, linguistics, and physics. I actually expect
that by the time you graduate it will be offered in a half-dozen more subjects.
There is an enormous demand for programmers in the work force in a number of fields.
For example Biology didn't used to be a computer intensive field, but now that
the human genome project is underway, it is. What you're learning in this class
is one language - python, but which language you learn first turns out not to
matter too much. Once you learn one language it's pretty easy to pick up whatever
other language you need. The skill you're learning is to think like a computer.

**Computers are kind of dumb (don't tell anyone I said that.)** People think they're
incredibly complex and scarey, but honestly I think it's more useful to think of
them as dumb. They will only do exactly what you tell them to do, and no more.
They'll do it really fast, and on much larger data sets than you would have the
patience to analyze by hand, but they'll still only do what you tell them to
do. The things students say that lead me to believe they haven't yet accepted
this fact of computer dumbness are things like, "My computer hates me." or "It's doing
something weird." Those mantras don't really help you find the error. The mantra that
will help you find the error is "this computer is dumb, and it can only do
what I tell it to do."

## You will:<br>
Develop problem solving skills including the following:
* Develop problem solving skills, specifically in solving problems you've never seen before.

* Develop your ability to determine if your answer is reasonable.

Develop programming specific skills including the following:
* Learn to think like a computer (if loops, for/while loops, functions, arrays....)
* Understand what `the cloud' is.
* Know how to make your program ``object oriented."
* Not be intimidated by reading large data sets in.
* Not be intimidated by weird error messages.
* Know how to ``debug" your program.
