You design the final lab of this course.  It’s an individual project. If something brought you to this course that we haven’t talked about yet, please consider designing your project around that.

### Project proposal (due soon after spring break – see grid):
Your project proposal will just be a paragraph (a few sentences) saying:
1) What data set(s) you'll be using.
2) What question you'll be answering using them.

### The Project 
(presented the last week of class, rough draft of poster due two
weeks beforehand - see grid):

**The POSTER is not really a poster anymore**
Poster -> 3 slides of a power point presentation.
* Slide 1: Introduction to your data set (where you got it, why you're interested in it, what question you hope to answer, why you think other people would be interested in this question.)
* Slide 2: An interesting challenge your data presented. You might show a little (a very little!) bit of code here, but the main point is to describe the challenge, and the overview of how you solved it.
* Slide 3: Conclusion and graph or graphs.

Not a lot of words on slides, please. 

You could probably make a draft of slides 1 and 2 from what you've done already, in about 25 minutes.

The point of this is to give Dave, me and TAs a starting point for conversations about your project, so that we can help you as much as we can.

For your draft due on Friday, you could make a draft of a final plot, or you could describe what you think the plot will look like, or even sketch it on a piece of paper, and put a photograph of it into your slide.

These will be submitted via Box on Friday.

If you need more time let me know, but better than that, turn in what you have on Friday.

If you have multiple graphs, the conclusion "slide" could be multiple slides.  But remember that this isn't a PhD thesis, so you really don't need more than 1 or maybe 2 figures.


**Your project must include**:
*	Background about why this question is important.
*	A physical conclusion drawn from data or simulations.  In other words, it has to answer a question and you have decide what question that is.
*	A test suite of at least three tests that your code passes (See Dave’s 2nd lecture, class #21.) These can be simple tests that your code is working correctly.  Your code must pass them. 
*	Documentation. (Your code must be commented).

**Your project must incorporate 5 of the following 10 elements:**
*	Reading in a public data set 
*	Simulating a data set
*	Plotting one parameter vs another and using the plot for analysis of some kind
*	Modeling the data (e.g. fitting a curve) 
*	Assessing the validity of your model using residuals or other techniques such a chi-squared 
*	Using only a subset of the data that meet some criterion
*	Calculating statistics from your data and drawing conclusions
*	Evaluating the time different parts of your program take
*	Dictionaries or panda data structures
*	Numerical integration

**There are many public data sets.**  See here for a list: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2016/02/12/big-data-35-brilliant-and-free-data-sources-for-2016/#6a2e0b72b54d

### How is this graded?
This is the 5th lab so it's part of your lab grade. 
It’s graded on the 9 required elements above (3 points for each), plus I add one criteria that’s just basic awesomeness (did you get into it?) and creativity (did you use your skills to make it cool?) (combined for 3 more points) for a total of 30 points.

### 3-slide powerpoint presentations
*	The main product of the project is the 3-slide powerpoint that you’ll show to the 
rest of the class during the last week of classes.   You'll also turn in the notebook
that shows you completed the items above.

## THE FINAL WEEK

Please sign-up for a presentation day [here:](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1X5jyvYeOLBLCTU8l9AzsxTGIirumbHbndwGk5iKjnfA/edit?usp=sharing).

During the final week of class you will do two things:
1) present your work (about 5 minutes)
2) listen to your class mates present their work and ask them questions (10 minutes of questions allotted for
each project).

(In case you're doing the math - you'll be in groups of 9 discussing each other's projects.  It'll take you
all 3 days to hear all 9 projects.)

You have an assignment to do while your classmates are presenting:
[Template for Q and A](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13B8gXVWKjKFlbleTWplkWegASVQh81IayDm8HNuUzMk/edit?usp=sharing)

At the end of the week you'll submit three things via haverford.box:
* your responses to the template above to a pdf file 
* your presentation slides (in pptx or pdf)
* your Jupyter notebook (file -> download as -> an ipynb file)

The Jupyter notebook should contain the following labels so that Dave and I can
easily see you've satisfied the criteria of the project
* Test suite
* Element1
* Element2
* Element3
* Element4
* Element5
