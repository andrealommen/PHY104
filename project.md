You design the final lab of this course.  It’s an individual project. If something brought you to this course that we haven’t talked about yet, please consider designing your project around that.

### Project proposal (due soon after spring pause – see grid):
Your project proposal will just be a paragraph (a few sentences) saying:
1) What data set(s) you'll be using.
2) What question you'll be answering using them.

### The Project 
(presented the last week of class, rough draft of slides due about a week 
week beforehand - see grid):

**The TALK**

It'll be 3 slides long:
* Slide 1: Introduction to your data set (where you got it, why you're interested in it, what question you hope to answer, why you think other people would be interested in this question.)
* Slide 2: An interesting challenge your data presented. You might show a little (a very little!) bit of code here, but the main point is to describe the challenge, and the overview of how you solved it.
* Slide 3: Conclusion and graph or graphs.

Not a lot of words on slides, please. 

For your draft due on Tuesday 12 April (a couple weeks before the end of the semester), you could make a draft of a final plot, or you could describe what you think the plot will look like, or even sketch it on a piece of paper, and put a photograph of it into your slide.
I find that even just making a sketch of what I think the plot (or plots) look like help me think about how to make them.

If you have multiple graphs, the conclusion "slide" could be multiple slides.  But remember that this isn't a PhD thesis, so you really don't need more than 1 or maybe 2 figures.


**Your project must include**:
*	Background about why this question is important.
*	A conclusion drawn from data or simulations.  In other words, it has to answer a question and you have decide what question that is.
*	A test suite of at least three tests that your code passes.  These can be simple tests that your code is working correctly.  Your code must pass them.  One of the tests must involve you feeding some data into your code, data in which you know what the answer should be. Do science on your code!  (You could actually create a CSV file that's sort of small fake version of your real file, and show that your code behaves as expected.) 
*	Documentation. (Your code must be commented).

**Your project must incorporate 5 of the following 10 elements:**
*	Reading in a public data set 
*	Simulating a data set
*	Plotting one parameter vs another 
*	Modeling the data (e.g. fitting a curve), or doing some numerical analysis such as a correlation analysis 
*	Assessing the validity of your model using residuals 
*	Using only a subset of the data that meet some criterion (e.g. just some rows from your table using the "loc" method or np.where)
*	Aggregating Data (e.g. combining all the different entries for cities in Pennsylvania into one combined entry for Pennsylvania)
*	Dictionaries
*	Numerical integration
* 	Use object-oriented programming to accomplish any of the above (e.g. a class and a method)

**There are many public data sets.**  See here for a list: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2016/02/12/big-data-35-brilliant-and-free-data-sources-for-2016/#6a2e0b72b54d

### How is this graded?
This is the 5th lab so it's part of your lab grade. 
It’s graded on the 9 (4 + 5) required elements above (3 points for each), plus I add one criteria that’s just basic awesomeness (did you get into it?) and creativity (did you use your skills to make it cool?) (combined for 3 more points) for a total of 30 points.

### 3-slide powerpoint presentations
*	The main product of the project is the 3-slide powerpoint that you’ll show to the 
rest of the class during the last week of classes.   You'll also turn in the notebook
that shows you completed the items above.

## THE FINAL WEEK

Please sign-up for a presentation day [here:](
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fHfmumgC68f5EPQWtYbUrSy2-SnyMsVxRIW-YTa7VNw/edit#gid=0).

During the final two weeks of class you will do two things:
1) present your work (about 5 minutes)
2) listen to your class mates present their work and ask them questions (10 minutes of questions allotted for
each project).

You have an assignment to do while your classmates are presenting:
[Template for Q and A](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13B8gXVWKjKFlbleTWplkWegASVQh81IayDm8HNuUzMk/edit?usp=sharing)

At the end of the week you'll submit three things via Moodle:
* your responses to the template above to a pdf file 
* your presentation slides (in pptx or pdf)
* your Jupyter notebook (file -> download as -> an ipynb file)

The Jupyter notebook should contain the following labels so that I can
easily see you've satisfied the criteria of the project
* Test suite
* Element1
* Element2
* Element3
* Element4
* Element5





## ROBOT PROJECT
If you elect to do a robot project instead of a data analysis project, here is how it will be graded:

To get a 10/10 on the project you must:
* Articulate a set of specific requirements that you want your robot to be able to perform.  There must be three of them that do not overlap with the requirements that the rest of the class had (i.e. one of the requirements cannot be that the robot can navigate autonomously around furniture using its whiskers).  The requirements must be specific enough that you can say objectively whether or not the robot was able to accomplish them. (e.g. “the robot can grab stuff” is not specific, but “the robot is able to lift an object and travel with it for one meter” is specific.”)
* For each of the requirements, describe the challenges in meeting (or not meeting) that requirement (one paragraph each)
* Describe changes you would make to your robot if you had more time.  Knowing what you know now, are there things you could do to make meeting your requirements easier? 

Also note that I have a small budget for purchasing additional equipment for your robot, if that would help you do your project.
