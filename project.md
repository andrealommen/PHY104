You design the final lab of this course.  It’s an individual project. If something brought you to this course that we haven’t talked about yet, please consider designing your project around that.

### Project proposal (due soon after spring break – see grid):
Your project proposal will just be a paragraph (a few sentences) saying:
1) What data set(s) you'll be using.
2) What question you'll be answering using them.

### The Project 
(presented the last week of class, rough draft of poster due two
weeks beforehand - see grid):

**Your project must include**:
*	Background about why this question is important.
*	A physical conclusion drawn from data or simulations.  In other words, it has to answer a question and you have decide what question that is.
*	A test suite of at least three tests that your code passes (See Dave’s 2nd lecture, class #21.) These can be simple tests that your code is working correctly.  Your code must pass them. 
*	Documentation. (Your code must be commented).

**Your project must incorporate 5 of the following 10 elements:**
*	Reading in a public data set 
*	Simulating a data set
*	Plotting one parameter vs another and using the plot for analysis of some kind
*	Modeling the data (e.g. fitting a curve) 
*	Assessing the validity of your model using residuals or other techniques such a chi-squared 
*	Using only a subset of the data that meet some criterion
*	Calculating statistics from your data and drawing conclusions
*	Evaluating the time different parts of your program take
*	Dictionaries or panda data structures
*	Numerical integration

**There are many public data sets.**  See here for a list: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2016/02/12/big-data-35-brilliant-and-free-data-sources-for-2016/#6a2e0b72b54d

### How is this graded?
This is the 5th lab so it's part of your lab grade. 
It’s graded on the 9 required elements above (3 points for each), plus I add one criteria that’s just basic awesomeness (did you get into it?) and creativity (did you use your skills to make it cool?) (combined for 3 more points) for a total of 30 points.

### Poster presentations
*	The main product of the project is the poster that you’ll show to the rest of the class during the last week of classes.  You’ll have to figure out how to show the awesomeness of your project in only one 11x17 page.

### Some examples of projects:
*	Show that a particular correlation does or does not exist in the 1940 census data: https://www.archives.gov/research/census/1940 (later census data is not available yet by the 72-year rule.)
*	Show that the original COBE microwave background data fit to a perfect black body law at 2.73 degrees Kelvin. (This is a relic of the big bang.)
*       Sorry this is sort of a lame list of examples.  The ones you've come up with so far are much better.  I'll use yours as example for next years projects!!!
