### How do I get to the hub?
The login screen is [here!](https://notebook.kinsc.haverford.edu:8000/hub/home)

### How do I change my password?
On the home screen of your Jupyter hub account you have an option on the top right for "new" -> "terminal." That will open up a terminal window on the hub. Type "kpasswd" and then press "enter". Here's what it looked like when I did it just now (the first password it asks for should be your old one - the terrible one I showed you in class):
> alommen@notebook:/$ kpasswd
> Password for alommen@KINSC.HAVERFORD.EDU:
> Enter new password:
> Enter it again:
> Password changed.
> alommen@notebook:/$

### Why doesn't it work when I'm off campus?
Because we had to put it behind Haverford's firewall for security purposes.  To get on it from off-campus (like from Bryn Mawr, or from home on break) you'll need to connect to Haverford's VPN (Virtual Private Network). It's best to get this set-up well before you need it, because it takes several days to get access.  If you're not a Haverford student there's one extra step you have do. Go [here](https://iitskb.sites.haverford.edu/knowledge-base/virtual-private-network-vpn/) to request an account.

Then go [here](https://iitskb.sites.haverford.edu/knowledge-base/installing-the-vpn-client/) and install the client. 

When you get this all set up you'll "Connect" to the "VPN Server" first, and then the Jupyter hub will let you log on. I'd be happy to show you what it looks like on my computer.  It's not particularly obvious how you use it.
