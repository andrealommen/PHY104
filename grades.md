Here's how I calculate your grade:

Labs 40%  (this includes the final project as the 5th lab) <br>
Robot 10% (You just have to get your robot wandering around the room to get full credit for this part of the class) <br>
Midterm 20% <br>
Final Exam 30% <br>

You'll be able to see your grades on Moodle.
